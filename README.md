## It's a text-bast RPG I'm making in python

* It's a text-bast RPG where you inreract thogh typing numbers
* using python classes to keep track of stats

I'm plaing on it being a game with a difind map but I will try to get AI, spasificly llama3, to make the discriptios of rooms an mostors.

Curretly I have only implamted a very basic combat system with only the one fight.

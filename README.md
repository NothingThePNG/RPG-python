# Python RPG
## It's a text-bast RPG I'm making in python

* It's a text-bast RPG where you inreract thogh typing numbers
* Using python classes to keep track of stats
* Using ollama to make dicriptions of rooms with llama2

I'm plaing on it being a game with a difind map but I will try to get AI, spasificly llama3, to make the discriptios of rooms an mostors.

Curretly I have only implamted a very basic combat system 2 very small maps with the abbility to bove between rooms and llama2 making dicriptions of rooms.

Reacently added leveling up and a save system
